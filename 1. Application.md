### Overview ‚ùáÔ∏è

If you're going through this Partner Handbook, by now you're already accepted in to the program. Congratulations üéâ In the next few steps, as an organisation you will:

* Create a problem statement/project for students to complete for evaluation 
* Post the Octernship project on GitHub Global Campus for students to view and apply
* Review and shortlist students for the Octernship, who will eventually work with your organisation

This guide includes additional information regarding GitHub Global Campus and GitHub Classroom, which are critical to the Octernship experience. All partners are expected to complete the designed flow for each Octernship Project

Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- [x] You have already signed the Non-commercial MoU with GitHub.
- [x] You are in the onboarding process of GitHub Octernships Program

_Note: Once a student has been paired with a partner, the expectation is that the partner will onboard the student into their organization and officially begin the Octernship._

<br>

### Octernship project creation with GitHub Classroom üë®üèº‚Äçüè´

‚ÄºÔ∏è **Do no share any GitHub Classroom URLs directly with students.**

*GitHub Classroom is only for partners to manage submissions, students do not interact with GitHub Classroom and all activity occurs in GitHub for them.*

GitHub Classroom is used to manage Octernships, the integrated tools makes it easy and seamless for you to review, support, and manage multiple projects during the Octern selection period. As next step you need to create a Classroom assignment for the Octernship project you want to submit. The following section will help with your first Classroom Assignment.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cHRy3kU.png)


Octernship Project created by partners will be distributed by GitHub Classroom, GitHub Education‚Äôs assignment management tool, where partners can easily distribute and manage their created projects using a simple dashboard interface. GitHub Classroom will generate repositories for each student who wants to complete the project. Once the repository has been created, it will appear on a dashboard interface for partner management.

Know more about[ GitHub Classroom](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom). 


## Creating a template repository üîó

All opportunities use a GitHub repository to disseminate information to students. We request that partners use our [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) to generate an appropriate README for the Octernship program. This template repository will help you to:

* Share information about your organisation
* Detail the Octernship role and qualifications
* Share the project(s) required to qualify for this role
* Evaluation instructions and submission

Use the `Partner Informational and Assignment README Template` available below.


### Partner Informational and Assignment README Template üîó

This template allows a Partner Organization to create a GitHub repository, which primarily displays basic information about the organization, problem statement, and resources that a student can refer to while applying to an organization.

```

### üêô SAMPLE: Partner Information and Assignment Repository üíñ

Here is a [Sample Repository](https://github.com/education/Octernship-Demo-Project) of an ideal Octernships Project.

## Setting up GitHub Classroom

*As a partner organisation, you should have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) to setup your GitHub Classroom. To begin, navigate to the [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and click the sign-in to get started* 

![](https://i.imgur.com/11FTKYP.png)


Once you have signed in, expect an blank GitHub Classroom Dashboard. You can now create a classroom by selecting ‚ÄúNew classroom‚Äù
![](https://i.imgur.com/bowc2bZ.png).



You will notice that you‚Äôve been redirected to a page requesting that you select an organization for your new classroom. _Note: GitHub Classroom uses organizations to manage classroom assignments._ Therefore, every student who applies to your organisation by accepting to the project, will open a new repository within your organization. We recommend creating a new organization(free/based on your existing billing plan) for every Octernship Project you list. You can create a new organization by clicking `create an organization`.
![](https://i.imgur.com/Z20AAnW.png)


Once your organization has been created, select your new organization for your new GitHub Classroom. You will be immediately prompted to name it to create your Classroom. We recommend using the company or project name as the Classroom name. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/lnhdCev.png)


Now that you have created a Classroom you will be presented with options to add collaborators to your organization. If you plan on reviewing candidate projects with a colleague, we highly recommend following the steps to `Invite TAs and admins` otherwise you can skip this step. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/NlNDezR.png)

  The last option will ask if you want to add a roster to your classroom. You can skip this step by clicking `Continue`. _Congratulations! You have setup your first GitHub Classroom!_

### Creating your first assignment (a.k.a project) ‚ú®

Now that you have your first classroom you can now create an assignment, which will serve as your project for students. You can now select ‚ÄúCreate an assignment.‚Äù

*Once you have successfully created a Classroom assignment for your Octernship Project you can submit that project for review to the GitHub team. The following section will help you completing the Octernship Project Application form.*


![](https://i.imgur.com/vh89sJm.png)


We require that all opportunities use a GitHub repository to disseminate information to students. We request that partners use our [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) to generate an appropriate README for the Octernship program. You can find the template [here](#partner-informational-and-assignment-readme-template).

Once you have filled out the template, you can submit your project to GitHub Education using the Project Application form.



## Application Form üîó

An Airtable form will be sent to all accepeted Partner organizations point of contact via email. It is required to submit your project related information to GitHub Education to proceed with the next steps. The form will capture information like: Organisation Name, Point of Contact, Bio, Logo, Favicon, Stipend, Project Repository URL, GitHub Classroom Assignment URL, Category and more.

üì∫ GitHub Octernship Stream is a 30 min LIVE session for all Octernship Partners to deliver technical education content on their product/service and expectations from the Classroom Assignment. This will be broadcasted on GitHub Education YouTube. 



#### Submitting multiple Octernship projects ‚ú≥Ô∏è
Each submission to GitHub Octernship is unique, We ask you to submit a new application for each new opening you may have. This also means the new project will have a unique GitHub Classroom Assignment and Stipend.

Example: If you have two available openings for GitHub Octernship you should submit two Octernship Project Applications containing respective classroom assignments and stipend information.

After the information for your project has been collected, we will review the repository (typically 7 days). After the repository is reviewed and approved, we will send you an email and post the project to our student platform, [GitHub Global Campus](https://education.github.com/students/octernships). The accepted projects will go live on the GitHub Octernships page on the _assignment start date _and will stop accepting submissions after the provided _assignment end date _provided in your application_. _During this time, you can make use of [GitHub Discussions](#heading=h.v7525k4g1v0d)_ _to allow questions and provide support to students working on your project.


#### Reviewing student submissions ‚úÖ


![](https://i.imgur.com/RGC4a2t.png)


When you are ready to review student submissions, you can visit student repositories by visiting your GitHub Classroom dashboard. Visit [https://classroom.github.com/classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms), select the classroom you created, select the assignment, and see a student roster with students who have accepted your project. To view the student repositories, use the ‚Äúrepository‚Äù hyperlink.


![](https://i.imgur.com/Vi5aiat.png)


Once in the repository, you can review the student commits and their pull request, and communicate with the student via the pull request/issues to schedule a further evaluation and connect with them. You can also use GitHub search capabilities to find code, keywords etc across student repositories. 

You can also use [GitHub search](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github) capabilities to find code, keywords etc across student repositories. 


#### Selecting candidates for your Octernship ‚úÖ

Once a shortlisted/selected student by a partner organisation, accepts the offer on GitHub Global Campus both partner and students will be notified via email. There after organizations can proceed with their independent organisation level onboarding steps. 


#### Application FAQs ‚ùî

* We have been asked to make changes to my application
    * If the GitHub team needs more information or requires a change in part of your application, you must re-submit the entire Airtable form with updated information
* Octernship Start or End dates are tentative/variable for our organization
    * Please reach out to [partners-octernships@github.com](mailto:partners-octernships@github.com) immediately and inform your change
* We don‚Äôt mind an upper limit to my Octernship Assignment
    * We highly recommend setting a maximum value due to the high volume of applications. A large number of applications can lead to delays in evaluation and push deadlines back
