## üìï GitHub Octernships Partner Handbook

### Overview üîÑ

Welcome to the [GitHub Octernships Program](https://education.github.com/students/octernships), and congratulations on joining an exciting initiative! This handbook contains all the necessary information to ensure a great experience in the program. 

As a partner, you play an integral role in shaping the future of open-source development and fostering the growth of the next generation of developers. You are expected to actively participate by providing mentorship, guidance, and support to students assigned to your projects. Octernships offer students and industry professionals a unique opportunity to work on open source projects, contribute to the community, and gain real-world experience in a collaborative environment. 

We have designed a structured process for each Octernships project. Familiarize yourself with this flow and follow the guidelines to ensure a positive experience. We look forward to working together to empower students, foster collaboration, and drive innovation in the world of open source development. Thank you for your dedication and support!

### Quick and easy step-by-step guide üìã

 üöÄ **Introduction Call:** If you are reading this handbook, it's probably because you have already applied to the program, signed the MoU, and done the introductory call with our team. Congrats! 

 üìù **Submit an Octernships project interest:** Using GitHub issues, you will submit your project idea for our team to review, approve and set it all up for you. This helps clearly describe the project, its goals, and the skills required. Be sure to include any specific guidelines or requirements for the students.

 üñáÔ∏è **Create an assignment for students:** Our team will create a repository for your Octernships assignment that you will use to shortlist students. These templates are designed to provide a structured framework for your project, including necessary files, documentation, and milestones. Customize the template to align with your specific project needs.

 üìä **Review and select students:** Once ready, your project will be published for students to apply and solve the assignment. After the deadline, you will start reviewing their submissions. Carefully review their profiles, resumes, and any sample work they provide. Evaluate their skills, experience, and alignment with the project requirements. Select the most suitable candidates for your Octernships project.

üöå **Onboard students at your company:** After sharing the final list of selected students with our team, you can move forward and onboard the students at your company, following your hiring process. Introduce them to the project's codebase, tools, and resources. Provide them with the necessary access and permissions. Set clear expectations, establish communication channels, and define project milestones. 

All the items will be discussed in more detail in this handbook!

### 1. Introduction Call üöÄ

During our introductory call, you may have noticed that our team has already set up a dedicated GitHub repository for your organization and granted all the required members access. If there are any additional individuals you would like to add to the repository, please inform us so that we can provide the appropriate permissions. 

We recommend including all relevant members from your company who will be involved in the project, as communication between our teams will primarily occur through GitHub issues following the introductory call.

### 2. Submit an Octernships project interest üìù

In the [GitHub-Octernships](https://github.com/GitHub-Octernships) organization, go to [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/GitHub-Octernships/repositories) and click on your organization name. There, go to issues and start a new one with a template named [‚ÄúSubmit new Octernships Assignment‚Äù](https://github.com/GitHub-Octernships/Partner-onboarding-template/issues/new/choose). Fill in all the information requested and click ‚ÄúSubmit new issue‚Äù. 

When you're ready to start your first project, open an issue in the repository we've set up for your organization. Here's how:

   1. Go to [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/GitHub-Octernships/repositories) in the [GitHub-Octernships](https://github.com/GitHub-Octernships) organization and find your organization's name.
   2. Click on the Issues tab and start a New issue using the "Submit-new-Octernships-Assignment" template.
   3. Fill in all the requested information in the template and hit Submit new issue.  

This issue is mainly to show your interest in submitting a project and provide all the essential details about it. Our team will review and approve. 

From then on, all our communication will happen in the issue through comments. This helps us keep track of all the processes throughout your project. Everyone assigned to the issue will get an email notification whenever someone adds a comment.

Once your project's interest is approved, the Octernships team will create a second repository specifically for your assignment. We'll provide more details about this in step 3 below.

### 3. Create an assignment for students üñáÔ∏è

After our team has approved your project interest and created a second repository specifically for your assignment, your team will receive an email invitation to join that repository.

Please update the README template with all the relevant information for your project assignment. Remember, the assignment is the task students must solve and submit to apply to your Octernships project. It acts as a way to test and shortlist qualified students for the position. The difficulty level and type of tasks will be determined by your team.

Once you have prepared your assignment, simply notify our team by commenting on the project issue. We will review it and request any necessary changes. Once the assignment is approved, our team will make it public and share it with the students on the designated date you have set for the project to go live.

### 4. Review and select students üìä

Reviewing student submissions is straightforward: our team will handle the manual work and grant access to limited student repositories based on their code commits within the deadline.

This approach ensures that you only review legit applications. To begin the review process, visit their repositories and assess the quality of their submissions. Take the time to check their profiles, contributions, and anything else you deem necessary, such as conducting an interview. To facilitate this, communicate with the student via the pull request to connect directly with them and schedule further evaluations. 

Once you have completed the review and finalized your selection of students, please collect their GitHub usernames and share them with us by commenting on the project issue. It's important to provide your preferences, including a waitlist of students. For example, if you are looking to hire two students for the project, let us know the names of the two preferred candidates and provide two additional students for the waitlist in case one or both of the preferred students decline the offer.

### 5. Onboard students at your company üöå

Congratulations! You now have Octerns and can embark on an exciting Octernships journey. 

If you've reached this point, it means you have successfully identified a qualified student (or multiple students) who has accepted your offer to work on your project. All that's left to do is initiate your company's onboarding process. GitHub does not play a role in this process; it will be conducted directly between you and the Octern, following your standard procedures for hiring interns or employees, including payment arrangements.

*Remember, effective communication, regular check-ins, and providing guidance and support throughout the process are crucial to a successful Octernships experience.*

### Submitting multiple Octernships projects üìö

A new issue and repository must be created for every new project you have. Let's review that: 

If you're submitting multiple projects simultaneously, you must create a new issue in the same organization repository our team has created for you. But for each new issue/project, a new assignment repository must also be created. Don't worry, our team will also handle the new repositories. 

This approach recognizes the uniqueness of each submission and allows for a focused assessment of individual openings. Creating separate issues makes it easier to organize, track, and review the applications, ensuring that each opportunity receives the attention it requires from potential applicants and the Octernships team.

After creating a new issue, the program flow is the same and follows the same steps mentioned in this handbook.

## Communicating in the program üí¨ 

[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/education/Octernships/blob/main/1.%20Application.md#heading=h.v7525k4g1v0d) are a great way to make public discussions and announcements during the selection phase of the Octernships. Community members can ask and answer questions, share updates, and have open-ended conversations. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum. Discussions give space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.

#### Promoting healthy conversations üë•
People with write permissions for the repository, or for the source repository for organization discussions, can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see [Managing discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions).

#### Staff Communication (GitHub) üìß
All communication with GitHub Staff can be done directly on GitHub, in the comments of your project‚Äôs issue by tagging @GitHub-Octernships/program-manager . You can also email *partners-octernships@github.com*.
